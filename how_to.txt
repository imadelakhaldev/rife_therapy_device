You can find how to design the device using an Arduino Uno board in other files. However, just use the exact schematic, wiring, and pins if you don't know what are you doing.
Replace the FREQS_LIST to whatever frequencies you need, and don't forget to change the FREQS_LIST_COUNT number to how many frequencies you're using.
Connect two wires, one to pin number 9, and the other to GND. hold them and the process will start.
