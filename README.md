Resonant frequency therapy device based on the original Dr. Rife invention.
Hello!
I've read and watched a few videos and articles that talk about a new magical way to shatter cancer cells using resonant frequency. The resonant frequency was described as a physical phenomenon where we create a frequency that matches the frequency of another object, so the object will be destroyed.
I remember reading an article that talks about one of Nikola Tesla's experiments with resonant frequency that led to nearly destroy a building in New York.
I found that Dr. Royal Rife was an American inventor who already made a device that can cure cancer and other diseases using resonant frequency, simply by passing electricity through an isolated human body in a specific frequency for each disease.
I found very positive reviews for such an invention, where people tried to copy it and got healed quickly from cancer.
I understood the core concept, how it works, I found a list of proven frequencies, so I decided to make one and share it with the community.
I tried it for a week... And trust me, it's super effective! (At least me for me).

PLEASE USE THIS DEVICE ON YOUR OWN RISK, DO YOUR RESEARCH SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND MORE.

For sure this device needs a lot of improvements. For now, it's doing the core function of resonant therapy, I'll be updating this topic whenever I made an improvement.
